# advanced-voting-machine
A voting machine with smart features using Arduino UNO R3 atmega328P.
This is a system designed to be used to reduce fake and multiplle votes that are leading to selection of illegal leaders.
Here one will use a voter id(RFID) card to eneter into the system if he/she is a valid user.
In this system everyone will give vote digitally through buttons attached on the front of the machine and the values of votes will be recorded automatically.
Finally the returning officer can count the vote using his/her secret code entered.
